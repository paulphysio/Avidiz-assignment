*Problems:*

Ensuring that the data was in the correct format and complete.
Normalizing the data to ensure that there were no duplicate or redundant information.
Developing an appropriate data model that accurately represented the relationships between entities.


*Solutions:*

Data was cleaned and formatted using techniques such as chunking and dataframes to ensure accuracy and completeness.
An ER diagram was created to visualize the entities, keys, attributes and relationships in the data, which helped in normalizing the data.
A database structure was implemented with all required tables, fields and keys to store the normalized data.


*Possible Visualizations:*

Bar graphs or pie charts to show the distribution of data across different entities.
Line graphs to show trends over time.
Maps to show geographical distribution of data.


*Reflection on Learning Outcomes:*

Understanding the importance of data formatting and normalization in database implementation.
Gaining practical experience in creating ER diagrams and implementing database structures.
Developing skills in querying and visualizing data.
